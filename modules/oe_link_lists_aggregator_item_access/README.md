# OpenEuropa Aggregator item access

This module provides the permission `view feed items` which grants users the capability to view feed item entities.

This module is useful in conjunction with `oe_link_lists_rss_source` to allow users to view RSS link lists without
granting them the permission to access aggregator feeds entirely.
